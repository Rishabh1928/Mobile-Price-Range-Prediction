# Mobile Price Range Prediction

## Problem Statement

In the competitive mobile phone market companies want to understand sales data of mobile phones and factors which drive the prices. The objective is to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM,Internal Memory, etc) and its selling price. In this problem, we do not have to predict the actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is.

We can see this from two perspective:

1) Business POV: This will basically help companies to estimate price of mobiles to give tough competition to other mobile manufacturer.

2) Consumer POV: It will be useful for consumers to verify that they are paying best price for a mobile.

## Data Summary

We have records of 2000 mobile phones with 20 columns/features. Each column represents the features of the mobile.

## Data Description

Data Description:
The columns that we have in our dataset are:

Battery_power - Total energy a battery can store in one time measured in mAh

Blue - Has bluetooth or not

Clock_speed - speed at which microprocessor executes instructions

Dual_sim - Has dual sim support or not

Fc - Front Camera megapixels

Four_g - Has 4G or not

Int_memory - Internal Memory in Gigabytes

M_dep - Mobile Depth in cm

Mobile_wt - Weight of mobile phone

N_cores - Number of cores of processor

Pc - Primary Camera megapixels

Px_height - Pixel Resolution Height

Px_width - Pixel Resolution Width

Ram - Random Access Memory in MegaBytes

Sc_h - Screen Height of mobile in cm

Sc_w - Screen Width of mobile in cm

Talk_time - longest time that a single battery charge will last when you are

Three_g - Has 3G or not

Touch_screen - Has touch screen or not

Wifi - Has wifi or not

Price_range - This is the target variable with values of 0(low cost), 1(medium cost),2(high cost) and 3(very high cost).
